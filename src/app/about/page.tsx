                <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    I’m Rania Zarka—a devoted home cook, avid traveler, and digital artisan. My journey began in the enchanting land of Lebanon, where every meal is a celebration of rich tradition and vibrant spices. My adventures have carried me from the bustling cities of the USA to the serene landscapes of Denmark, each chapter adding a new flavor to my culinary repertoire.

                <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    Traveling the globe has gifted me the opportunity to explore diverse food cultures, each with its own unique charm and allure. These experiences inspire me to experiment with innovative recipes, ensuring that every dish tells a story of passion and creativity.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    As a proud parent, I delight in discovering kid-friendly recipes that bring smiles to little faces. I love inviting friends and family together to share the joy of a home-cooked meal, where tradition and innovation blend seamlessly on every plate.
